A little project to implement the greyscale mode.<br>
On some phones it is coupled with the sleeping mode. This project can use the greyscale mode without sleeping mode.

## v1.1.2
1) included in the Reset Task a "accessibility_display_daltonizer_enabled" to 0 to try to Bugfix the bug where the greyscale mode don't turns off

## v1.1.1
1) smaller text and bigger text fields. Better visibility with display zoom and bigger text size in Android options (if not set to very big...)

##  v1.1.0
1) added "Change Color" button, with which you can change the border color of the app-scene
2) "Reset" button will now reset everything the standard
- start and stop time
- border colo
- "paused till" and "disabled to next periode" times * turn off the Greyscale-mode

## v1
+ first version
